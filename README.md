It downloads all images in the featured section of an account on Deviantart. The featured section may not contain all the users images.

Once you input an account name and press enter, it will start fetching the images. That looks like the following:

```

pg:0:image_2_name Downloaded
pg:0:image_3_name Already Downloaded                                    #example of a file already downloaded
pg:0:image_4_name An unknown error occurred: list index out of range    #example of something bad happening
```

# Message Meanings

Downloaded = The image was successfully downloaded.

Already Downloaded = The image was already downloaded.

An unknown error occurred = Not good.
